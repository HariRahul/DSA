## What is a Datastructure?
> A data structure is how we store and organize data to find/retrieve/store the data as efficiently as possible

## Types of data structures
There are **two** main categories of data structures i.e ***primitive*** and ***non-primitive*** data types

### Primitive data structures
This includes ***Integers, Float, Boolean, Characters, etc*** which form the basic building blocks of other complex data structures.

### Non-primitive data structures
This includes more complex data structures. This is again split into ***linear and non-linear data structures***

- Linear data structure :
    > Data is stored in sequential order. This can be again split into ***direct access and sequential access***. Direct access is arrays and matrix where you can directly access each element using it's index or position. Sequential access includes Linked list, Stack, queue where you can't directly access an element but traverse through the data structure to get to the desired element.

- Non linear data structure :
    > This is of types ***Hierarchical and unordered*** Hierarchical data structures are tree, trie, heap, etc. Unordered data structures include graphs, sets, hash tables that have no specific order in the way they store data.
