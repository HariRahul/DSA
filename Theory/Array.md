# Array

Array is a data structure that contains multiple objects of the same type with a fixed length with a contiguous memory allocation. This definition is more suitable for Java. In Python it can contain elements of different data types too and not of a fixed length.

Array contains the following operations.
- Insertion O(1)
- Deletion  O(1)
- Traversal O(n)
- Retrieval O(1)

In Java there are in-built functions for many array operations
- Copy array using Arrays.copyOfRange(source Obj, int from, int to)
- Equality check using java.util.Arrays.equals()
- Sort array using Arrays.sort()
- length

Fixed length arrays are declared as below
```
int[] intArray = {1,2,3}
```

For a growing array, declare a linked list or array list
